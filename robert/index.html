    <h1>ok here's the bullet pointed to do list for idiots who cant focus (me)</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>figure out how to initiate the game</li>
    <li>decide if i want a start button, timer feature</li>
    <li>for timer, manually count 1 and remove until there is no mroe itme</li>
    <li>make a mini algorithm for fake enemies, include variables for eagerness to bet, random scale for relative value of item and how much other people are willing to increment</li>
    <li>figure out where to source the items</li>
    <li>working money system: do not let the player go into debt</li>
    <li>make the bidding system, which probably incorporates everything above in an iteration loop.</li>
    <li>for each second, percent chance is gamble'd for someone who wants it</li>

  </ul>
